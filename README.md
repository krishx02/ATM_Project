# ATM_Project
Project is finished as of 12/26/2020 and I am going to be working on KeyTracker next.

This project consists of 5 classes in total, Account, ATM, Bank, Transaction and User

ATM is the class with the main method that runs everything else. It displays options that the user can put in and you
can traverse through multiple classes depending on if you want to check transaction history or deposit money. Each user
that you create, the person running the program, has a unique ID with a default checking and savings account.

The other classes consists of keeping track of all of that information along with methods that update those objects,
such as getting the transaction history which can be retried by going through the arraylist of transactions
for that specific user. 

I was inspired by multiple java projects on YouTube.
 
* Things that I have learned from this project: 
 
* The importance of static vs. non-static methods. 
 
* Writing comments down for each method and comments throughout your code inside of the methods.
 
* MD5 and Random library. Security purposes, hashing algorithm.
 
* Refreshed on java concepts and feel a lot more confident working with big programs
 
* Working with libraries and traversing through documentation when unfamiliar with unknown libraries
